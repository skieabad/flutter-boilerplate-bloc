# Flutter Boilerplate

A Flutter boilerplate project using BLOC as a state management system without using the flutter_bloc package.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository and run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

You can also do by running the following command:

```bash
sh scripts/clean.sh
```
Note: This command must run in the root directory of the project and use `git bash` as terminal if you are using Visual Studio Code as IDE.
